# button-clicker
You’ve come up with a cool idea for an app. It’s a clicker with two buttons. One to increase a count and one to decrease it. You’re going to make this available on the web and see what happens! You just know it’s going to blow up. It’s a big project, so you’re making a front-end only MVP first. In a code sandbox (or similar) present both a functional and beautiful click counter.
